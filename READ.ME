To use this script you just have to edit these files:

delegatetokey.exp -> Put your wallet unlock pass in there
widthdraw.exp -> Put your wallet unlock pass in there

delegatetovali.sh and widthdrawfromvali.sh -> Put your validator address, wallet pubkey and wallet name in those two files.

Then, to run the script, you just have to run the loop_validator_funds.sh loop

Have fun!
